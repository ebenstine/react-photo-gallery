## Description

 This crud app is a clickable gallery of light studies I took in my old house.  When the page loads, you can click the photo the images disappears and a brief description of the image clicked appears in its place.  There is also a like button below that can be clicked and will update a count with how many times it has been clicked.

- `App` - This represents the overall application of the site.
- `GalleryList` - This represents the gallery of images. 
- `GalleryItem` - This represents a single image within the gallery of images, which is capable of flipping back and forth between the visual and its text description with a click.
